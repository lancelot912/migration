            <p>As a third-world country, the Philippines is abundant in hard-working people with an effort that is second to none. However, the effort doesn't equal high-paying jobs, 
                making it difficult to continue working in the country. If the goal is to help their families be better, the solution is to find work overseas while sacrificing time 
                to be with their families. Overseas Filipino Workers or known more as OFWs, are the driving force to the Filipino economy as their significant contributions fuel the 
                growth leading to developments and opportunities for the betterment of the Filipino future. As of <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/pressrelease/Press%20Release%202019%20SOF%20signed.pdf">2020</a>, there are estimated 2.2 million OFWs around the world. </p>
